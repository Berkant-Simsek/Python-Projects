## Project 1
Would you like to open a pizza shop? Then this project could be your dream project. The project aims to allow users to design their own pizza and add the user to the database after payment. So what kind of tasks do we have in this project? The Pizza Order system starts with the users choosing the pizza on the menu and the sauces they want. They have to pay with their choice of sauce and pizza. Users are required to pay by credit card. Each pizza has a description and price. Note that these values must be set as a constant value within the classes.
